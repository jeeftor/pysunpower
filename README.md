This is a python module to parse the unpublished REST Api for SunPower PVS6 modules. The information is gleamed from a vareity of other projects out there including all the ones mentioned [here](https://starreveld.com/PVS6%20Access%20and%20API.pdf)

From my limited understanding the API will ilkely depending on the model of equipment you have and as such this "may" or "may not" actually work for you.


# Development / Testing

I've included a very simple Docker container for "mocking" out a response in order to test this module out if you so desire.
